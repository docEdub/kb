Has anyone tried to package a WebXR application in an APK ? I found this older thread on Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WebVR/comments/dd8ah6/how_to_publish_webvr_games_as_native_apps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WebVR/comments/dd8ah6/how_to_publish_webvr_games_as_native_apps/ "https://www.reddit.com/r/WebVR/comments/dd8ah6/how_to_publish_webvr_games_as_native_apps/")

Look into PWA. Both Android Play Store and Microsoft Windows Store should support PWA as store apps now.

PWAs work great, wonderland will be releasing one-click PWA support with next version.

I implemented PWA install button in Worlds Demolisher. Didn't get to use the Quest in the last month or so. Did they implemented PWA yet?

non trivial

_[_1:20 PM_]_

We have a WebXR pseudo polyfill we shipped for a client

_[_1:21 PM_]_

Using capacitor, which is an offshoot of cordova

_[_1:21 PM_]_

But real WebXR requires you to compile chrome with a flag off ![:cry:](https://discord.com/assets/f6d30507f4baee759bc9d7e5c0d3ba4f.svg)

_[_1:21 PM_]_

So WebXR currently is only supported in Chrome, not Android browser apps (i.e. webviews in apps)

_[_1:22 PM_]_

Bai was able to get this running with Electron, similar but different process

_[_1:22 PM_]_

And it should be possible but non-trivial to compile Cordova, Capacitor, etc with WebXR support(edited)

_[_1:24 PM_]_

@slt @lancelumix In the meantime people are just emulating the API and driving with native ARKit and such, and we have a plugin that demonstrates most of this that can get you started: [https://github.com/XRFoundation/native-xr-for-web](https://github.com/XRFoundation/native-xr-for-web "https://github.com/XRFoundation/native-xr-for-web")(edited)

Here you can package a PWA to a TWA (trusted web app) for the play store. Don't know about App store. [https://www.pwabuilder.com/](https://www.pwabuilder.com/ "https://www.pwabuilder.com/")(edited)

Did this with my AR app earlier this year. Worked like a charm.

## shaw _â€”_ 08/27/2021

NP, @Michael Vogt 's solution is the easiest

## Michael Vogt _â€”_ 08/27/2021

The only problem is, that the use of WebXR isn't recognized automatically and added to the Android manifest. So the app is also offered to devices that aren't compatible. Maybe I would use the cli that's used by PWABuilder instead (don't remember the name...) next time and add this to the Android manifest manually.
